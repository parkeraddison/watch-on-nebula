# 'Watch on Nebula' extension

> "I didn't realize that creator was on Nebula."

Nor did I, my friend. But I would like to support them!

## What is this?

A Firefox- and Chrome-compatible extension that will prompt you to watch videos on [Nebula](https://watchnebula.com) when possible.

Whenever you load a YouTube video, this extension will check if the creator is part of Nebula, and if so will prompt you with a link to watch their content over at Nebula instead.

## How to use

Simply add the extension from the official site correponding to your browser.

- **Firefox**: [link - todo]
- **Chrome**: [link - todo]

That's all!

## Why is this important?

If you're subscribed to Nebula, your watch time is what directly supports your favorite creators.

## Credits

The concept for this extension was wholly inspired by [this post by u/duckduckohno](https://www.reddit.com/r/watchnebula/comments/juqa5d/suggestion_youtube_subscription_tool/), and the implementation was sparked by [this one by u/KevineCove](https://www.reddit.com/r/watchnebula/comments/ek0zwh/list_of_current_creators/) on the r/watchnebula subreddit.
